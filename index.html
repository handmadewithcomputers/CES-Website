      <h2 class="text-center">A Circular Economy</h2>
      <p>At the intersection of business and commerce lies the potential for transformational sustainability via the shift to a circular economy. Circular Economy is literally a re-envisioning of the current linear economic model of Take, Make, Use, and Discard. Continuing down this path will only lead to resource depletion and business constraints for  all industry sectors. Businesses that can reimagine the linear process will secure their place in an increasingly material competitive environment. The Circular Economy provides a  framework for businesses to become integral players in a thriving closed loop business system that moves well beyond eco-efficient, incremental step changes and impact measurement. The fundamentals of a circular economy are to:

        <cite>- John Muir</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Industrial processes since the dawn of the Industrial Age in the mid-18th century have depended on planetary plunder for economic prosperity. The ensuing economic progress and material wealth have left behind a legacy of waste, pollution, toxicity, and systemic degradation. We believe that this track can be changed, while enhancing any company’s economic and brand performance.</p>
      <p>Many high demand substances relied on for industrial processes are nearing depletion and  may lead to sector failure. Leading companies are acknowledging that business as usual may no longer serve as a long term strategy, recognizing that  our planet’s carrying capacity is taxed. At the same time savvy customers, consumers, advocacy groups  and the media are steadily demanding more - accountability, transparency, stewardship, and exceptional brand experience. The take, make, use, and discard road to profits is threatened in the resource-constrained future. Companies that make the shift to a Circular Economy will position themselves to out-compete in such a future, while enhancing their brand offerings and customer loyalty.</p>

        The linear production and consumption path that brought a web of environmental woes into the 21st century can be made circular through focused engagement in six core areas.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <div class="row">

      <div class="grid grid-75">
      
        <p>
          Businesses and industry affect these areas through myriad activities in a global industrial ecosystem. This connectedness can be leveraged to channel material inputs withdrawn from the planet into long term circular flows. Each company must walk the path that suits its corporate culture, its internal timelines, and its unique relationships with supply chain partners, customers and consumers. Progressive public policy can provide incentives that help companies find their way forward.
</p>
   <div class="row row-center">
<h3>From Risk to Opportunity</h3>
<p>
Typically, these six core areas are approached individually, and each represent significant risks to business and community. Yet, these core issues do not exist as standalone problems. They are fully interlinked as with all of natural ecology. Hence, when viewed as a living system, each core area represents strategic opportunities to leverage circular economy principles to drive out inefficiencies and build in resilience. Resilience is the key to brand strength in the 21st century. It is at the heart of thriving ecosystems and communities - industrial and natural.

    <div class="grid">

      <i class="fa fa-flask"></i>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <p>
        Our current global system of commerce  is inextricably tied to finite materials, whether they be raw substances such as minerals and ores, or highly technical materials such as plastics and metals. There is abundant evidence that the linear production and consumption model  is exceptionally wasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
        A circular economy business model, that advocates for Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) in contrast is restorative and:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>promotes material stewardship and traceability from cradle (extraction) to factory gate (processing)</li>
        <li>endeavors to eliminate toxicity along the life cycle of the material from cradle to grave (disposal at end of useful life),</li>
        <li>designs in the fate of the material upon the end of its useful life to close the material loop (recycle, repurpose, revalorize).  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
      <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i>
      <h3>Energy</h3>
      <p>The fast pace of innovation in a consumptive global society is fueled by ancient sunlight in the form of petroleum, natural gas, and coal, which emit mega-tons of greenhouse gasses and other pollutants. The implications of climate change affected directly by the extraction and burning of fossil energy is poised to affect all living systems on the planet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Circular Economy energy is derived by  harnessing current or new sunlight as well as wind, water and other renewable sources of power. 
</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>
      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>Although the Earth is predominantly a water planet, water availability vary greatly by region exhibiting abundance and scarcity. The effects of climate change, pollution, litter, flow diversion and temperature changes are leading to drastic shifts in quality, quantity, and availability for humans and the co-inhabitants of the planet.
</p>

<ul><li>Best practices in the Circular Economy will minimize water usage while optimizing opportunities for recovery, reuse and closed-loop flows. 
</li></ul>
     
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i>
      <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>The impacts of industrial pressures on ecosystems globally is irrefutable.  The human population projections for the next few decades and subsequent demand for resources will inevitably affect every living system on the planet. </p>

<ul><li>Companies that shift to a Circular Economy business model understand the impacts and redesign their resource flows to eliminate these externalities, begin to reverse the damage done and respect the value of ecosystem services.</li></ul>

    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>
      <h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>There is no scientific doubt about the role of humans and their reliance on fossil fuels as the root of global shifts in climate. This central issue may unhinge all other systems including human societies and everything they take for granted. </p>

<ul><li>Under Circular Economy, the way energy is consumed and the fuel sources that generates the energy is shifted rapidly to renewable infrastructure. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Systems-level resilience is essential for everything from food, water, energy, material resource, communication, transportation and much more. 
</li></ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-comments"></i>
      <h3>Community </h3>
<p>As developing economies grow so does the impact on communities from linear, non-sustainable industrial practices and business systems.   </p>

<ul><li>Circular Economy business models create an equilibrium between the social contract to operate in a community and  access its local resources with the benefits (health and wealth) it returns to the community. Job creation, living wages, infrastructure development, and education are among the key elements of that social contract, which ensure and guarantee shared value.</li></ul>
