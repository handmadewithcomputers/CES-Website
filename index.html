      <h2 class="text-center">A Circular Economy</h2>
      <p>At the intersection of business and commerce lies the potential for transformational sustainability via the shift to a circular economy. Circular Economy is literally a re-envisioning of the current linear economic model of Take, Make, Use, and Discard. Continuing down this path can only lead to resource depletion and business constraints for  all industry sectors. Businesses that can reimagine the linear process can secure their place in an increasingly material competitive environment. The Circular Economy provides a  framework for businesses to become integral players in a thriving closed loop business system that moves well beyond eco-efficient, incremental step changes and impact measurement. </p>

      <p>Industrial processes since the dawn of the Industrial Age in the mid-18th century has depended on planetary plunder for economic prosperity. The ensuing economic progress and material wealth has left behind a legacy of waste, pollution, toxicity, and systemic degradation. We believe that this track can be changed, while enhancing any company’s economic and brand performance.</p>
      <p>Many high demand substances relied on for industrial processes are nearing depletion and  may lead to sector failure. Leading companies are acknowledging that business as usual may no longer serve as a long term strategy, recognizing that  our planet’s carrying capacity is taxed. At the same time savvy customers, consumers, advocacy groups  and the media are steadily demanding more - accountability, transparency, stewardship, and exceptional brand experience. The take-make-use-discard road to profits is threatened in the resource-constrained future. Companies that make the shift to a Circular Economy will position themselves to out-compete in a resource scarce environment while enhancing their brand offerings and customer loyalty.</p>

      <p>
        The linear production and consumption path that brought a web of environmental woes into the 21st century can be made circular through focused engagement in six core areas.</p>

        <p>
          Businesses and industry affect these areas through myriad activities in an global industrial ecosystem. This connectedness is a dual-edged sword that can be channeled towards circularity of material inputs withdrawn from the planet. Each company must walk the path that suits its corporate culture, its internal timelines, and within the uniqueness of its relationships with supply chain partners, customers and consumers.

      <h2 class="text-center">Core Issues</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="grid">

      <i class="fa fa-flask"></i>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <p>
        Our current global system of commerce  is inextricably tied to finite materials, whether they be raw substances such as minerals and ores, or highly technical materials such as plastics and metals. There is abundant evidence that the linear production and consumption model  is exceptionally wasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
        A circular economy business model, that advocates for Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) in contrast is restorative and:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>promotes material stewardship and traceability from cradle (extraction) to factory gate (processing)</li>
        <li>endeavors to eliminate toxicity along the life cycle of the material from cradle to grave (disposal at end of useful life),</li>
        <li>designs in the fate of the material upon the end of its useful life to close the material loop (recycle, repurpose, revalorize).  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
      <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i>
      <h3>Energy</h3>
      <p>The fast pace of innovation in a consumptive global society is fueled by ancient sunlight in the form of petroleum, natural gas, and coal, which emit mega-tons of greenhouse gasses and other pollutants. The implications of climate change affected directly by the extraction and burning of fossil energy is poised to affect all living systems on the planet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Circular Economy energy is derived by  harnessing current or new sunlight as well as wind, water and other renewable sources of power. 
</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>
      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>Best practices in the Circular Economy will minimize water usage while optimizing opportunities for recovery, reuse and closed-loop flows. 
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i>
      <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>The impacts of industrial pressures on ecosystems globally is irrefutable.  The human population projections for the next few decades and subsequent demand for resources will inevitably affect every living system on the planet. </p>

<ul><li>Companies that shift to a Circular Economy business model understand the impacts and redesign their resource flows to eliminate these externalities, begin to reverse the damage done and respect the value of ecosystem services.</li></ul>

    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>
      <h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>There is no scientific doubt about the role of humans and their reliance on fossil fuels as the root of global shifts in climate. This central issue may unhinge all other systems including human societies and everything they take for granted. </p>

<ul><li>Under Circular Economy, the way energy is consumed and the fuel sources that generates the energy must be shifted rapidly to renewable infrastructure. 
</li></ul>

    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    <i class="fa fa-comments"></i>
      <h3>Community </h3>
<p>As developing economies grow so does the impact on communities from linear, non-sustainable industrial practices and business systems.   </p>

<p>Circular Economy business models create an equilibrium between the social contract to operate in a community and  access its local resources with the benefits (health and wealth) it returns to the community. Job creation, living wages, infrastructure development, and education among the key elements of that social contract, which must ensure and guarantee shared value.</p>

      <p>We recognize that each company is at different place on the path to transformational sustainability, and a one-size-fits all approach will not work. What is needed is the ability to take disparate parts of an organization’s activities and connect the dots between and among seemingly isolated events to create the living mosaic that make up the company’s core products and services. </p>
      <p>We are an atypical consulting group. We are interventionists,  who value curiosity, creativity, integrity, humor, and continuous learning. We immerse ourselves in your challenges, actively engaging your team and building their capacity. We believe it is essential to maintain perspective under conditions of information overload and time constraints to avoid competition-based approaches to sustainability efforts. Our approach seeks synergies among nontraditional and traditional supply chain partners. Circular Economy is an opportunity to break free of the business as usual approaches to sustainability and create a long-term virtuous cycle of capital building. We are the change agents that will enable your transition. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We seek to engage with your team in long lasting transformative change, and ensure team learning by doing</li>

    <p>We engage with clients committed to making the  shift to a Circular Economy business model. We offer a systems level strategy that encompasses design thinking, life cycle assessment, material flows analyses, best manufacturing processes, asset retention and/or recovery strategies, forward and reverse logistics planning, and total value chain integration. We ensure your team is also equipped with the tools and resources to continue the transformation and measure performance against benchmarks, collect critical data and disclose progress. In short, we help you think disruptively and move boldly.  
    </p>
    <p>A typical engagement might include one or more phases of engagement as mapped here:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phase 1: </strong>A product life cycle and design thinking exercise to identify inputs and outputs in current value chain and their value chain flows to uncover the best opportunity for a shift to circularity. During this phase we will:
      <ul>
        <li>identify pathways to smarter sourcing including consideration of material health</li>
        <li>identify opportunities to convert to or optimize the use of renewable energy</li>
        <li>map existing sources of inefficiency and waste and define process improvements to eliminate them including ways to create and maximize by-product synergies</li>
        <li>map new supply chain and customer relationships that will catalyze material circularity</li>
        <li>highlight opportunities to recover and reutilize valuable assets</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Phase 2: </strong>The development of a circular economy business strategy, based on phase 1 findings.  The strategy will layout deliberate tactics and steps that will enable a circular economy transition including the identification of internal champions to lead the effort and learn by doing.   </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Phase 3:</strong> Implementation of a pilot project to demonstrate proof of strategy and  document learned lessons. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Phase 4:</strong> Measure success of the pilot project, having baselined the former linear process, establishing key performance indicators and data collection protocols. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Based on the lessons learned in phase 3 and the performance assessment in phase 4, Identify replication opportunities  and a roadmap for the ramp up to a full transformation. </li>
    </ul>
